# API

The backend of the tools admin consists of a FastAPI that enables the endpoints through which the client will connect to the database.

## Run Dev Environment

Make sure you are in the api directory, you have all requirements installed and that you run `uvicorn index:app --reload`. The reload tag will redeploy server when a change is made in source code.
